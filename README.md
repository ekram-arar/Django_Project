This is Our Django Project in Axsos Academy

It's a web app to help people.. Living in a time where the world is dealing with the Corona virus pandemic and its social and economic consequences, we felt that our social responsibility is to create a website that would help families to minimize the health hazards of going out for grocery, and also for those who lost their jobs for the pandemic, or maybe looking for a second earning source, they can do so by joining our team.

Our Group : Salah Abu Karsh, Ekram Arrar, Mahmoud Waked
